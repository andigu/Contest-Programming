Contest Programming
===================
Contains all my programming work since 8/28/2016
* All programming problems I've solved
* Some resources (pre-built data structures)
* Previous CCC practice solutions
* Notes on some algorithms and data structures
* You can see my solved problems for DMOJ [here](https://dmoj.ca/user/andi_g/solved)

Notes
-----
* File names under the DMOJ folder represent the url of the problem they solve for. For example, a file called
ds1.py will be the solution for https://dmoj.ca/problem/ds1.
* The majority of notes come from Wikipedia and WCIPEG's online wiki. They are for self-reference only and I don't take
take credit for any of them.
